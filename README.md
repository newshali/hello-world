# hello-world
I want to learn about this system and site and I started with the world of greetings and training on the site and other dear friends.
Greetings to all of the world. I live in Iran and do not know English and I write and read with the help of the Google Translator.
I like this site and the system and I'm so glad to be here.
And thanks for the support of the administrators and the support team from now on, I also thank all my dear friends for the tips they are giving me in the future.
And I must also say that I'm really interested in working on the Internet, and I like to learn and work on my monetization sites and Bitcoin systems.
And now I am learning and basic settings.
